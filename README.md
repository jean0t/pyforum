# PYFORUM

Forum made in python with django 5.2. My goal with this project was 2, exercise my knowledge with the framework and make an useful application that you can get and host anywhere, the dockerfile will help you in achieve that due to the container.

## How to Use

1. Build the docker image with the tag python\_forum `docker build -t python_forum .`
2. Run the docker image with the port that you want `docker run -p <port you want>:8000 python_forum`
